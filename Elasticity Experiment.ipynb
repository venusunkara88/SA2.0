      "# Hooke's Law of Elasticity\n",

      "## Overview\n",
      "Hooke's Law suggests that the force associated with a spring when it is released is linearly related to the distance it has been compressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "An experiment was conducted to capture data for a number of springs across various compression lengths. The indent of the experiment is demonstrate Hooke's Law by showing that the results of the experiment lie on a straight line. Yet experiment data tends not to be perfect so we expect the results to lie around a curved line not necessary on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Could we use the results to fit a model that will allow us to depict the linear premise posited by Hooke? Can we use a linear regression to solve the problem?"
